2022-11-20:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

**Utilizing self-join** 
``` 
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Perosn p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;

```

For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

** GROUP CONCAT?!**
```
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC separator ',') AS products
FROM ACTIVITIES
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

Remember GROUP_CONCAT needs a separator 'xxx'
